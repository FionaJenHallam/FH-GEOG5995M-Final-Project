## GEOG5995M-Final-Project
# Background/Context of project
This project provides a framework for local authorities to assess and monitor the variable which has the strongest link to air quality. It can be used and adapted by any local authorities/stakeholders who wish to identify which dimension from the CDRC's AHAH multi-dimensional index which may be contributing to poorer health-related features of local areas (LSOA's).  

## What data the GitHub repository contains
Jupyter notebook
AHAH Index CSV file
UK data service LSOA 2011 CSV file
Geoportal gov zip containing shape file

## What the code aims to do
The code walks the user through the data science process through reading in appropriate packages and files, checking and cleaning the data, identifying the variable with the strongest correlation to air quality, visualising the relationship between the identified variable and air quality and finally plotting the variables actual and relative spatial distribution on a map.
